# Performance Bouncback - High Immersion Specialization
![Alt text](/Screenshots/perfMain.PNG?raw=true "Warehouse Overview")

## Overview
This project was chance for me to practice my newly learned optimization skills from the Nanodegee program. Udacity presented me with a VR game that was extremely unperformant, my goal was to use my talents to optimize it to a consistent 90fps.

## Why this project?
Performance optimization is one of the most important skillsets for a VR developer, since apps running below the target framerate are essentially unplayable, causing nausea and discomfort. This project simulates a real-world scenario where a VR game has been hastily built with a focus on functionality rather than performance (a common approach while prototyping). Youâ€™ve been hired to take the game and make it a performant app ready for release.

## Some Challenges
In this project, I learned that utilizing lightprobes properly is just as much art as it is science. I was a bit nervous about my implementation here but the reviewers reassured me that I took a great approach.

## Skills utilized
This project was about combining various ideas and skills I've been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Using static and dynamic batching
* Optimizing physics
* Creating object pools
* Caching variables and optimizing code
* Setting up lighting with MSAA
* Baking lighting
* Using light probes
* Using the profiler for performance optimization


## SDK
